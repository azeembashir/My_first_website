    <p>The first time I had Kabuli Pilau, also known as Afghani Pulao, was in my first year of college, at a local restaurant with my family. I remember seeing the dished out serving platter of lightly browned rice, scattered with glistening raisins and carrots covering large chunks of meat and thinking 'Oh, well. Guess I'm not eating tonight'.

        Before that night, I was ethically against mixing sweet and savoury together. But that was before that night.
        
        That night, I learnt that sweet + savoury combinations have the potential to be insanely good - but only if all the flavours are balanced juuuuust right. Afghani Pulao/Kabuli Pilau just gets that combination ohhhhhh so right! The way the sweet, juicy raisins and carrots complement the savoury, moreish meat and the mellow, soft flavour of the spice-infused rice.
