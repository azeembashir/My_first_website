    <p>Haleem is a rich and delectable mutton stew, popular in the Middle East and Asia. As common as it is in India, particularly in the city Hyderabad, it is surprising to know that Haleem actually has originated from Persia. It is eaten in plenty of other parts of the globe but most commonly by Muslims, especially in the holy month of Ramadan, for the Iftar while breaking their fast.</p>
