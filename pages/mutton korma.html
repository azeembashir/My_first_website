    <h1>Mutton Korma:</h1>

    <p>Mutton korma is a classic rich and fragrant curry to prepare for a special occasion such as Eid, a family get-together, any kind of special event.

        In my humble opinion, mutton korma wins over chicken korma any day because the extra long cook time means all the flavours infuse into the meat more, the flavours become richer and more intense and everything melds together so so deeply. 
        
        This is an authentic, real deal mutton korma recipe. I've used the traditional technique and proper spices which come together to make that authentic, asli zaiqa of a korma I am certain you will love. </p>
