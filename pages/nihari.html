        Nihari is a deliciously smooth flour based stew with slow cooked mutton and a myriad of spices. This mutton nihari recipe takes ~4 hours to cook but itâ€™s easy to put together. To get the best flavour, the mutton is cooked on very low heat for upto 4 hours.

        Traditionally Nihari was cooked all night and then served to the Mughal Kings of Delhi in breakfast after the morning prayers.
        
        From the royal kitchens of the Mughals, the dish has now crossed all borders of region, religion, and course. However, since it takes a long time, almost 5 hour, to cook Nihari, it is mostly reserved for special occasions like Eid dinners and other festivities.
        
        The first time I had nalli nihari was after my marriage when I was exploring the world of non-vegetarian cuisine. I was told it was one of the dishes that has converted many vegetarians. I loved the nihari stew and I could see how between Sikander and daddy the whole 1/2 kg mutton nihari was finished in just one meal. That meant I had to learn how to make nihari.</p>
