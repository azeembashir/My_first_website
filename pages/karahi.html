    <p>Chicken Karahi is prepared in a special cooking utensil,  the Karahi (pronounced Ka-ra-hee) a deep cooking vessel with two handles similar to a wok but with slightly steeper sides. So the name Chicken Karahi is after the cooking vessel. There is also another similarity with Chinese style of cooking in a wok that Chicken Karahi is also prepared using stir-fry method. Only a few ingredients are used in it’s preparation, bone-in chicken, tomatoes, garlic and ginger along with simple Pakistani spices. The karahi gets the kick of heat from fresh green chilies and chili flakes. It’s a semi-curry (drier curry) where the masla clings to the chicken pieces making them even more flavorful.

        Whereas Chicken Tikka Masala is a boneless chicken curry with a creamy and luscious tomato base infused with spices</p>
