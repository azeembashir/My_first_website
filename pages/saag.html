    <h1>Saag:</h1>

    <p>Sarson is the Hindi/Punjabi word for mustard and saag means greens; thus, this recipe is for the traditional Indian preparation of mustard greens. Other versions of saag include: Palak Saag (spinach greens), bathua saag, or Chane ka Saag (chickpea greens).

        Sarson ka saag is a type of curry, so it is creamy, saucy and simply addictive. Traditionally, it is served with an unleavened corn-based flatbread known as Makki di Roti, though it can also be served with Paratha and steamed basmati rice.
        
        This sarson ka saag recipe is a labor of love, requiring both time and patience. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut method for making this dish.
        
        You’ll need to sort the greens, then wash, chop, and cook them before blending them, after which you’ll need to cook them again. It is a labor-intensive process, but none of the steps are difficult.
        
        While I’m aware that everyone wants their curry in a hurry nowadays, if you really want to savor the taste of an authentic sarson da saag then you’ll have to invest some time in preparing it.
        
        The sarson ka saag recipe is very easy, but does take a lot of time to make; as such I like to break up the steps over the course of a few days.
        
        Usually, I clean the greens one day before and keep them in the fridge in airtight containers so half of the work is over. Making the saag the following day makes it feel much easier.</p>
